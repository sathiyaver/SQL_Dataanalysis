        "*   A SQLite3 database named `student_database.db` was successfully created, and a table named `students` with columns `id`, `name`, `roll_no`, `class`, and `marks` was defined and created within it.\n",
        "*   Python functions for each CRUD operation (`add_student`, `view_students`, `update_student`, and `delete_student`) were successfully defined and implemented. These functions handle database interactions including inserting, selecting, updating, and deleting records based on student details and roll number.\n",
        "*   Error handling, specifically for duplicate roll numbers during insertion and for cases where a student is not found during update or deletion, was included in the respective functions.\n",
        "*   A demonstration of the CRUD operations showed that students could be added, all students could be retrieved and displayed, an existing student's record could be updated based on their roll number, and a student's record could be deleted based on their roll number.\n",
