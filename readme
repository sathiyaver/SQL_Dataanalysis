# 🛍️ Online Retail Sales Analysis using SQL in Python (SQLite)

## 📘 Overview

This project performs **data analysis on an Online Retail dataset** using **SQL inside Python (SQLite3)**.
The main objective is to explore and summarize business insights such as **total revenue**, **top-selling products**, **best customers**, and **monthly sales trends**.

The project demonstrates:

* Loading Excel data into SQLite
* Running SQL queries using Python
* Cleaning missing/duplicate data
* Optimizing SQL performance using indexing

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 🧩 Tools Used

* **Python (Pandas, SQLite3)**
* **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**
* **Excel Dataset:** `Online_Retail.xlsx`

### 📦 Installation

No extra installation is required since `sqlite3` and `pandas` come pre-installed with Python.

```python
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
```

### 💾 Database Creation

1. Load dataset:

   ```python
   df = pd.read_excel('Online Retail.xlsx')
   ```
2. Create SQLite database and table:

   ```python
   conn = sqlite3.connect('online_retail.db')
   df.to_sql('online_retail', conn, if_exists='replace', index=False)
   ```

### 2️⃣ Top 5 Products by Revenue

```sql
SELECT StockCode, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS total_revenue
FROM online_retail
GROUP BY StockCode
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

| Rank | StockCode | Total Revenue |
| ---- | --------- | ------------- |
| 1    | 71053     | 20.34         |
| 2    | 85123A    | 15.30         |

### 4️⃣ Top 5 Customers by Spending

```sql
SELECT CustomerID, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS total_spending
FROM online_retail
WHERE CustomerID IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY CustomerID
ORDER BY total_spending DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

| Rank | CustomerID | Total Spending |
| ---- | ---------- | -------------- |
| 1    | 17850      | 35.64          |

---

### 5️⃣ Monthly Sales Trend

```sql
SELECT
  strftime('%Y-%m', InvoiceDate) AS sale_month,
  SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS monthly_revenue
FROM online_retail
GROUP BY sale_month
ORDER BY sale_month;
```

**Result:**

| Month   | Revenue |
| ------- | ------- |
| 2010-12 | 35.64   |

## 💡 Challenges & Learnings

| Challenge                       | Solution / Learning                                             |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Date column not recognized      | Converted `InvoiceDate` to proper datetime before SQL insert    |
| Duplicate entries detected      | Used `GROUP BY` and `DELETE` with subqueries to clean data      |
| Performance issues with queries | Created indexes on `CustomerID`, `StockCode`, and `InvoiceDate` |
| Missing values in CustomerID    | Deleted rows with `NULL` CustomerID to preserve integrity       |

### 🧠 Learnings

* SQL is highly effective for **data summarization** and **business analytics**.
* **Indexes** greatly speed up queries.
* Combining **Python + SQLite** is ideal for lightweight data analysis workflows.
