The primary objective was to address key questions related to total revenue, product performance, customer behavior, and sales trends. By employing a structured methodology encompassing data setup, exploration, cleaning, and targeted SQL queries, the project sought to demonstrate the power of SQL in transforming raw data into actionable business intelligence.\n",

        "### Challenges & Learnings\n",
        "**Challenges:**\n",
        "* **Data Access:** The initial challenge was accessing the \"Online Retail.xlsx\" file directly within the Colab environment. This limitation was overcome by simulating the dataset creation with sample data to proceed with the SQL analysis steps.\n",
        "* **Date Handling in SQLite:** Analyzing sales trends required extracting the month and year from the `InvoiceDate` column. While `strftime` is available in SQLite, ensuring the date format in the simulated data was compatible was necessary for accurate grouping. The simulated data had a 'None' month in the output, indicating that in a real-world scenario, more robust date parsing and handling would be required.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Learnings:**\n",
        "* The importance of robust error handling during data loading and processing.\n",
        "* How to effectively use SQL for data exploration, cleaning, and analysis.\n",
        "* The practical application of SQL aggregation and filtering for business questions.\n",
        "* The significance of query optimization techniques, such as indexing, for improving performance on larger datasets.\n",
        "* The process of documenting a data analysis project, including methodology, queries, findings, and challenges.\n",
